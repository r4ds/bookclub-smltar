"],["book-club-meetings.html", "Book club meetings", " Book club meetings Each week, a volunteer will present a chapter from the book (or part of a chapter). This is the best way to learn the material. Presentations will usually consist of a review of the material, a discussion, and/or a demonstration of the principles presented in that chapter. More information about how to present is available in the github repo. Presentations will be recorded, and will be available on the R4DS Online Learning Community YouTube Channel.

For example: - using a text that has been broken into sequences of characters for recurrent neural network - morphology - utilizing the part of speech information as feature - syntax Most linguists view speech primary to written language (technological). Analyzing written text can be limiting as it less “creative” and more abstract.
